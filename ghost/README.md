# Ghost

Created by Hannah + Demetrius for MUSC 208.

This Max program incorporates external hardware into the production of a song. With the use of a phone application that tracks phone movement, you get to 'conduct' this piece yourself. 

Movements like tilting your phone, shaking it, raising it higher, and bringing it lower all impact the strength of certain auditory elements.
